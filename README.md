To make this work you need to be running LMStudio in server mode for it to connect to.

This has been tested on a the deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-7b model which is small and produces good results.

You will also need to have an MQTT server running. It has been tested with Eclipse Mosquitto:

You may also want to check on the MQTT server and check it is running locally properly. This can be done with MQTT Explorer:

Description:
Demonstrates the setup and interaction of LanguageAgent instances using MQTT-based pub/sub messaging
and an LLM backend in the cyber simulation core. Configures agents with system prompts, sends control
and direct messages, and logs agent responses. Useful for testing agent communication, message handling,
and LLM integration in a simulated environment.

Hi boss I have discovered a potentially malicious file on a company laptop. 
The file was not flagged by antivirus software, but exhibits unusual behavior: 
it attempts to communicate with an external IP address and modifies registry settings. 
However, it is also part of a legitimate open-source toolkit used by the development team. 
Should I escalate the this for full investigation?
